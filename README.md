# School_District Analysis
## 1.Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to clean a large csv data file with over 39k lines of data and to give details on school performance throughout this district on a macro level and to break down different variables to deep dive potential causes for varying performance. Variables include: school size, school type, school spending, and by grade level. 

The other variable tested through this analysis was to test the impact if a top performing school (Thomas High School) had a whole class' test scores changed to NaN, how would it impact the schools performance vs. district performance.
